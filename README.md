# VK_TableGenerator
A basic Windows virtual key-table (Map) generator for string-to-macro conversion.

Nothing complicated, but it gets the job done. The most up-to-date table output can be [found here](/VK_TableGenerator/vk.txt).

This generator does not use literals for existing macros, making it future-proof. If someone's willing to write in literal/hex generation, they're welcome to do it.
